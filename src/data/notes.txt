for problem 3: if (showHideFromMessage) { const groupMembers = [ { id: 1, name: 'Mom', avatar: '👩‍💼' }, { id: 2, name: 'Dad', avatar: '👨‍🦳' }, { id: 3, name: 'Sister', avatar: '👩‍🎓' }, { id: 4, name: 'Uncle John', avatar: '👨‍🦲' } ]; it is static data so for every group these 4 members comes only but i think groupmembers data need to come dynamically like just the members from the group so i think it need to fixed. 2. {showEmojiPicker === msg.id && ( <div className={`message-menu emoji-picker you stopped here give me the continuation code. 3.1. when i click on the header in chatwindow i'm not seeing group info like make admin, remove but i'm seeing empty white screen. 3.2. in group the messages are coming as expected but a small change don't include the avatar in the message show the avatar outside of the message bubble and in the message show the name and below name show the message for group chat window. 3.3 in chatwindow whether it might be individual one or group one the timing and ticks( i  think the  current ticks are not giving that much of ui, ux experience like whatsapp) need to come like as like as in whatsapp for this i'm attaching you a reference 4. when selected react option where ever might be the mouse or cursor the emojis need to show until clicked on anywhere else if clicked on anywhere else then need to click on chevrondown icon again and again react, when selected any emoji it need to come to bottom right for messages shared by me and bottom left for messages i received or for messages not shared by me now i'm not seeing anywhere the reaction emojis i clicked and when clicked on it it need to show all countofthereactions then next divide all the selected emojis only like for a message in group have four reactions 1 is hug, 2 are love, 1 is super with fingers then it need to show like all 4 hug emoji 1 love emoji 2 superwithfinger emoji 1 after clicking on these hug or love or superwithfinger it need to show user avatar name below to name reacted timing and if i reacted for message then for that only like my avatar you below you tap to remove when tapped on it the reaction need to go off emoji. 5. <div className="flex-1">               <h1 className="text-lg font-medium">Remove from {category.name}</h1>               <p className="text-sm text-green-100">{selectedMembersForRemove.length} selected</p>             </div> here selectedMembersForRemove.length i need to show the current members of that category. 6. when i click on add members and selected any members and click on add selected button it need to come to that specific category those remove members, remove category are working good but this one add members is the only one which not working as expected. 7. in chatwindow if i click on + icon in input field those options comes right and if i again i click on + icon they are not closing thats good i want the same functionality when i first click on + icon options comes right and then after i click anywhere else the options doesn't need to come. 8. for these "{ icon: '📷', label: 'Camera' },             { icon: '🖼️', label: 'Gallery' },             { icon: '📄', label: 'Document' },             { icon: '👤', label: 'Contact' },             { icon: '📍', label: 'Location' },             { icon: '🎵', label: 'Audio' },             { icon: '⏰', label: 'Timer' },             ...(chat.isGroup ? [{ icon: '👁️‍🗨️', label: 'Hide From' }] : [])" for these i want lucide-react icons. 9. in back arrow schedule message can you style the calender like instead of all the months we need to have current months calender right and that to today date and tomorrow date right as we are falicitating this service for only 24 hours so clicking other day in calender don't allow and in date input field clicking on anywhere show the calender as now it is showing only when clicking on calender icon, in the calender also change those fonts normal default fonts of the device, in time input field clicking anywhere in the input field need to open timer setting and the timer setting watch also need to be like the circle one as circle one will have 12 hours show anywhere am pm changing, set timer button is sticked bottom add some spacing to bottom of the button. when set any timing in between the 24 hours then the message need to send and it need to be in sending state only when the set time happens at that time the message need to delivered to the remote user or else you can send only the message when the time fulfills as now it is sending immediately even after i set timer. for hidefrom message shared the closed icon need to be not emoji it need to be lucide-react icon like the one you shown in back arrow hide from page and for timer message also it need to be lucide-react icon not emoji.
